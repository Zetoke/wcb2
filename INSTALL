OK. You've done. Now you have these sources, and you want to compile my nasty project.
Nothing easier:

First, you need autotools. Of course you have them already, haven't you? (If you have windows - you suck).
Next:
	
	-- run ./autogen.sh
	-- run ./confiure --help and choose any options, you want
	-- run ./congiure <params>
	-- run ./make && ./make install

If all was alright, you 'll have it installed. Any possible bugs:

	-- Ncurses. Please, be shure you have proper path(headers must be in /usr/include/ncursesw).
	   If they aren't make a symlink, or do this:
	
		sed -i 's|ncursesw/ncurses.h|ncurses.h|g' configure plugins/ncurses/ecurses.h
